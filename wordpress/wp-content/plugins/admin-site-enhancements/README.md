## Frequently Asked Questions

### How Do I Reset ASE Settings / Configuration?

If for whatever reason you need to remove ASE and reset the settings / configuration, please follow these steps:

1. Access your website via FTP and delete ASE plugin folder at /wp-content/plugins/admin-site-enhancements/
2. Login to your site via the default URL, /wp-admin/ or /wp-login.php
3. Install [SQL Buddy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sql-buddy/) plugin, open it, and click on the wp_options table
4. Use the small filter icon at the top of wp_options table rows, and filter for “option_name” => “contains” => “admin_site_enhancements”. You should get 3 options . Click on each one and hit the “Delete” icon in the bottom-right corner.
5. Re-install and re-configure ASE as needed.

You can skip step 1 and 2 if you still have access to your wp-admin dashboard.

### Does ASE Work With Multisite?

ASE does not officially support multisite. Please use at your own risk. That said, several users have reported that it works fine on their multisite when activated on each sub-site and not through network activation.

### 7.8.5.1 (2025.04.08) - ASE Free

* **[FIXED in Free] Admin Interface >> Admin Menu Organizer**: fixed an issue where saving changes in the new Admin Menu Organizer settings page (Settings >> Admin Menu) resulted in a 400 (bad request) HTML error. Props to [@mrmatteastwood](https://wordpress.org/support/users/mrmatteastwood/), [@wikis](https://wordpress.org/support/users/wikis/), [@anamazon](https://wordpress.org/support/users/anamazon/), [@tazmandev](https://wordpress.org/support/users/tazmandev/) and [@overspeed99](https://wordpress.org/support/users/overspeed99/) for swiftly [reporting the issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/admin-menu-cant-be-saved/) and sharing details that led to this fix.

### 7.8.5 (2025.04.07) - ASE Free

* **[IMPROVED in Pro] Security >> CAPTCHA Protection**: add an Advanced Options section for ALTCHA where you can set custom text for the different steps in the verification process. This can be useful if you need to quickly translate the default text. Props to @betaplus, Linda H. and Marcellus J. for prompting this improvement.

* **[IMPROVED and FIXED in Pro] Utilities >> Form Builder**: 
  * **Added an option to hide the form after successful submission**. This can be configured under form Settings >> Confirmation >> Confirmation Type >> Success Message. Props to Ignazio D.M. for prompting this improvement.
  * **Fixed layout issues on style template editor**. Fixed style editor not being full-width and the Publish button being contained in wide white box.

* **[IMPROVED in Free and Pro] Log In/Out & Register >> Change Login URL**: added handling for an issue when Gravity Forms is active and someone tries to open a URL that contains the `gf_page` parameter, e.g. to preview a form, while not being logged-in, it would then redirect to the custom login URL. That will now be prevented and the user will be redirected to the homepage instead. Props to Coan Z. for reporting this.
  
* **[CHANGED in Free and Pro] Admin Interface >> Admin Menu Organizer**: moved the admin menu settings to a separate Admin Menu page/item under Settings.

This also improves the usability of the menu organizer for sites with lots of menu items, especially when drag-and-dropping menu item to reposition it.
